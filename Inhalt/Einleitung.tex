% Introduction: lots of data -> cant save it all -> need a way to deal with it
% Examples of when it is applied
% How does it work, are there alternatives? yes -> batch processing (Maybe briefly explain)
The advancements in technology of the past decades has lead to enormous data creation. Technology has become ubiquitous, with the evolution of cell phones to smartphones 
and the digitilization of industrial processes, Industry 4.0, causing creation of information to grow exponentially.
It is estimated that the global datasphere (\fett{Todo: Explain in glossary}) will reach the size of 175 zettabytes by 2025, as shown in figure 1.1.

Data has become an important factor in decision making and optimization in virtually every industry, especially in finances. \fett{TODO: Wieso?}
The financial market is dominated by data driven decisions, with emphasis on data processing in a (near) real-time fashion.
However, real-time data is becoming of importance in multiple sectors; the International Data Corporation estimates that real-time data will be responsible for a share of 30 percent of the total global datasphere by 2025, as shown in figure 1.2.

A global study led by IBM in 2012 has shown that 71 percent of the firms in the financial market use information (including big data)
in order to achieve an advantage over their competitors, compared to 36 percent, which IBM has found in an earlier study conducted in 2010. [Todo: SOURCE]

As it is no longer feasible to save all the data before then analyzing it (in batches), due to computational cost and lack of storage capacity, a new approach was designed in order to handle data in a (near) real-time fashion, Stream Processing Systems (SPS).
