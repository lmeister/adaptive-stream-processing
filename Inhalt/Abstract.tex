Due to the ever increasing amount of generated data and the importance of data, stream processing systems are becoming more prevalent.
However, as data flows are not steady, a system often times is faced with over- or under utilization of its resources. 
Manual reconfiguration of stream processing applications, however, is hard and time-consuming.
In this thesis we explore self-adaptive stream processing systems as a means to overcome these problems. 
Our goal is to gain an overview of the topic of self-adaptive stream processing systems and to analyze two viable architectural patterns for such systems.
