abstract="The basic ideas of self-adaptive systems are not a novelty in computer science. There are plenty of systems that are able of monitoring their operative context to take run-time decisions. However, more recently a new research discipline is trying to provide a common framework for collecting theory, methods, middlewares, algorithms and tools for engineering such software systems. The aim is to collect and classify existing approaches, coming from many different research areas. The objective of this work is providing a unified metamodel for describing the various categories of adaptation.",

abstract="The massive usage of data streams dates back to artificial satellite information processing systems and to their commercial application in the early 1970s, such as in telecommunications switching, land monitoring, meteorological surveillance, etc. Today they are extensively used in monitoring systems applications based on wired and wireless sensor networks, in social networks, and in the Internet of Things [20]. The main functional goals of data stream management systems (DSMSs) are as follows: (a) results must be pushed to the output promptly and eagerly while input tuples continue to arrive and (b) because of the unbounded and massive nature of data streams, all past tuples cannot be memorized for future use. Only synopses can be kept in memory and the rest must be discarded.",
